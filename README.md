A software for digital audio player based on Raspberry Pi Zero 2W.
A newth edition of [daph](https://github.com/Elmonade/daph)(short for daphne), smaller and more efficient while maintaining the core functionality.

## Structure
Here, unlike daph, the structure is much more rudimentary and does not follow
any set of architecture. This allows us to keep the code base smaller and more
efficient - at the cost of maintainability.

## Controls
The display we using have a dedicated 3 buttons and a one d-pad. Which is not
enough buttons to map to every feature of the daphne. Thus, the buttons perform
different actions depending on the state the player is in.
